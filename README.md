# WTH (Top Down 2d stealth game)
Goal: Get out of there! @.@

## Setup Unity Instructions (CRUCIAL/MUST/CANNOT INTERACT WITH REPO UNLESS THESE ARE DONE)
## (5/12 IGNORE THIS ACTUALLY. IF YOU JUST GIT CLONE CORRECTLY, CHECK IF THESE THINGS ARE IN YOUR PROJECT (SHOULD BE) AND YOU'RE GOOD
1. Make sure since we're cross platform to go through these things:
CRUCIAL
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5834014/lf-will-be-replaced-by-crlf-in-git-what-is-that-and-is-it-important
(CLRF vs LF) 

2. Once Unity (Unity Hub preferred b/c can have different version. working on 2019.3.2f1) is installed
https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download

3. In the same link above: http://www.walterpalladino.com/adding-an-existing-unity-project-to-github/
make sure that you follow <Update the Unity Project> chapter. It allows us to mess with the meta data 
(meta data in unity is a big reason why unity projects in github break)

Then we're good to go!

## Git Cloning Unity Now After Above Setup
1. Git clone to wherever you want locally

2. Go to Unity Hub and press the 'Add' button in the 'Projects' tab\
- Navigate to where you git cloned the project locally

3. Open! And check out everything

## Workflow
Master is fine for now, b/c this is small and who knows if ppl are actually going to do stuff! 
So branches are really only needed if there's work on the same scene / asset / etc.
If there's a time where we need branches, that'd be cool. And I'd be happy to organize that.
